    <h1>Amuse Me</h1>
    <h3>By: Mariam Torres</h3>
    <p>Below I have listed some pages from the internet that entertain me. </p>
    
    <h2>Youtube</h2>
    <p>Here's is where I spend a lot of my time, I use Youtube for all sorts of things such as to watch funny videos from my favorite Youtubers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenoelmiller">Noel Miller</a>.</p>
    <p>I also use it to further my knowledge on things that I'm interested such as <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@nesoacademy/videos">coding</a>.</p>
    <p>Link: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>
      
    <h2>TikTok</h2>
    <p>If I'm not on Youtube then I'm on TikTok, this is one of those social media sites that if you're not careful you can mindlessly scroll through it for hours.</p>
    <p>I find myself spending a lot of time here as well, the TikTok algorithm caters uniquely to each viewer to craft an endless supply of content, it's made specifically for you.</p>
    <p>Link: <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/foryou">TikTok</a>
      
    <h2>Twitter</h2>
    <p>Twitter has always been one of my favorite social media sites. Similar to TikTok, Twitter supplies an endless amount of content to its users.</p>
    <p>Twitter shows relevant posts based on the user's interest and under its new ownership it has definitely become an interesting place.</p>
